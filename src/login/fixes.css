 * Zakarya here.
 *
 * I don't know if it's Keycloak or Keycloakify,
 * but all of the forms have a different layout
 * and architecture. Here is a list of fixes with
 * descriptions to make the theme work properly.
 * 
 * I didn't want to include this inside of main.css
 * because this stuff is messy and I want main.css
 * to have some semblance of order.
 *
 * Enterprise software for the win!!! /sarcasm

ul {
  list-style-type: disc;
  padding-left: 24px;
  /*/
   * Tailwind includes a CSS reset, but Keycloak
   * expects all ULs to have bullets.
  /*/
}

.kcInputWrapperClass .kcInputClass {
  width: 100%;
  /*/
   * idp-review-user-profile form
   * Make all of the inputs full width.
  /*/
}

/*/
 * I just want to leave a little note here,
 * these fixes are specific to this project
 * and the style we are going for; these won't
 * integrate well into a different Keycloakify
 * project. However, they may provide valuable
 * insight for anyone working with Keycloakify
 * in the future.
